# UI Test Plan

The `test-ui` skill uses this file as the source of truth for console UI tests.
Each test case records its aim, the console inputs, and the expected output after each input.

java -cp "%REPO_ROOT%\build\classes\java\test;%REPO_ROOT%\build\libs\nico.jar" nico.ConsoleTestAdapter
```

```build
